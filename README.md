# Alpha Omega Digital website

## Project Overview
This project is a result of my internship at Alpha Omega Digital, a distinguished web design agency located in Melbourne. The primary goal was to reconstruct their official website based on a Figma prototype, bringing it to life with full functionality. Additionally, Contentful integration was implemented to enhance content management processes.

## Key Responsibilities
* Website Reconstruction: I worked on translating the provided Figma prototype into a responsive and visually appealing website, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
* Content Management with Contentful: The project involved integrating Contentful, a headless CMS, to efficiently manage and update the site's content. This not only facilitated content organization but also allowed for easy updates without altering the website's structure.

## Technologies
* Contentful (Content Management System)
* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS
* React
